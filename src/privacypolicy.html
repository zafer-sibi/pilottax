                    <b class="font-semibold">Services:</b> We are committed to making your total experience a positive one. Upon entering your information, we will transmit your tax return information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); a process known as "e-file". We do not, however, guarantee that the IRS will accept your return. Although we take certain steps to ensure the accuracy of your return, it may be rejected for a variety of reasons, some of which are beyond our control. With this service, you are filing "self-prepared" taxes. We do not offer tax advice and make no guarantees or representations regarding the quality or accuracy of the data you enter.

This includes information such as your employer identification number, contact information (name, email, address), vehicle details, tax deduction(s), and information about your business, if any. With your consent, we will file your return with the IRS and charge you a fee for this filing service. In this case, some of your information will be sent to the IRS who will need this information to process your tax return. Billing information, such as a credit card number, will also be requested so we may process your order.
